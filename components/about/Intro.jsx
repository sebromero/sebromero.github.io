        <p>
          Hi, my name is Adriano Smith and I began using WordPress when it first
          began. I’ve spent most of my waking hours for the last ten years
          designing, programming and operating WordPress sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my specialties is taking an idea from scratch and creating a
          full-fledged platform. I go beyond to produce sites with a unique,
          outstanding, contemporary look-and-feel. With extensive knowledge of
          web mechanics, I’m able to optimize complex integrations to require
          little-to-no maintenance while running on their own for years.
        </p>

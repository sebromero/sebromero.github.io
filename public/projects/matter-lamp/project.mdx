# Starting Point

For the Hardware Pioneers Max 2024 conference in London, I was asked to create a demo that 
shows off the Arduino Nano Matter board's Smart Home capabilities. The board had been released just a few weeks before the conference took place.
I decided to go for something that is easy to spot from a distance and easy to understand by the audience.
Often the people at such conferences like to take a quick look at the source code.
The main value proposition of Arduino is ease of use, hence it was important to demonstrate how little code it takes to get this project up and running.

# Concept

For the mentioned reasons I dediced to go with an interactive lamp that can be controlled through a voice assistant.
The lamp can be turned on or off and the color can be changed, all through voice or by using the corresponding smart home app.

# Build

For the initial version I created a shield for the Nano Matter that hosts an ATTiny85 MCU. The ATTiny communicates with the Neopixel ring mounted on the top of the lamp's base.
I did this because the NeoPixel ring takes 5V but the Nano Matter operates at 3.3V. The ATTiny85 however can run at 5V. 
I could have used a level shifter but the only one I had at hand was the BSS138 based [Sparkfun module](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12009) that is too slow for the 800 kHz required by the WS2812b Neopixels.
So the idea was to use a co-processor that controls the LEDs.

The communication between the Nano Matter and the ATTiny was realized over UART.
The ATTiny doesn't have a hardware UART, but the Arduino core already features a bit-banged Software Serial interface.

The custom protocol just features one simple string based command: "Red,Green,Blue,Brightness"
E.g. sending 255,0,0,128 would make the LEDs go red at 50% brightness (128 out of 255).

Socket was designed for 50%, I increased it by 135% so that the NeoPixel Ring fits.

Among today’s challenges in smart agriculture is pest control, which traditionally involves usage of chemicals. Farmers can leverage Arduino’s solutions to collect and monitor data coming from insect traps on the fields. This way, professionals can estimate when a potential increase in infestation will occur and react quickly. In this workshop, Sebastian will walk you through the necessary steps to implement a smart, LoRa-connected insect trap.
